<p class="MsoNormal">The price to pay for the SRF10’s tiny transducers is that
the system is now very sensitive to objects way off boresight (boresight is the
angle where the sonar is aimed, that is, straight ahead).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In fact the sonar will respond continuously to the ground if aimed
horizontally and mounted at a height of 3 feet or less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The published curves show the response pattern in dB, but what is more
practical for my purposes is a plot of the distance an object will be detected
vs. its angle from boresight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
SRF10 responds to a narrow object 30 inches away at an angle of 60 degrees below
boresight, even with drastically reduced gain!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is certainly a false alarm for most applications (including mine).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reducing the gain cuts down the sidelobes somewhat, but not
enough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The pattern up and down (relative to the picture in
the book – looking at the component side with wires on left) is not
symmetrical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sonar is much more
sensitive to objects below boresight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
if you are mounting your sonar vertically (not side-by-side), mount it
up-side-down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And in any case, aim
the sensor UP about 30 degrees or more to avoid the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Probably the mounting supplied can be bent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I did some experiments to try to reduce the sensitivity off
boresight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I first installed a
paper tube around both aluminum cans on the sensor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I tried lengths of 0.8” and 0.5” (measured from the PC board) with
very similar results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I also tried
3/8”ID shrink tubing (without shrinking it) with similar results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I also tried fuzzy velvet ribbon, in 2 lengths, with dramatic
results.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These extensions form a tube a couple of wavelengths
(0.339”=8.6mm) long from the transducer, so there is some combination of
open-tube resonance, diffraction, absorption, and collimation happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But it seems to be mostly absorption, because the fuzzy ribbon works much
better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In every case, the
sensitivity off boresight is reduced markedly.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My experiment setup was to tape the sensor (aimed
horizontally, with transducers side-by-side) onto a horizontal turntable that
could rotate in azimuth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
turntable was mounted 5’ above the ground to avoid ground effects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I worked outside so there would be no interference from room reflections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I used a paper template to measure the rotation angle every 10 degrees
(you could print the template below).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
laid out a tape measure on the ground, with zero directly under the sonar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The target was a long ½”-diameter pole held vertically (using a wider
target would be hard to determine its azimuth).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I rotated the sensor to each 10 degree angle, moved the pole along the
tape measure from distant to closer, and recorded the distance where is sonar
responded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I also checked to be sure that there was no dead spot at that
angle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sonar is operated by a
PIC16F870, with the gain reduced to 100 (setting of 6 in the register, which
just barely detects the target at 53”), and max range reduced to 55”
(setting of 33 in the register).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
results as follows:&nbsp;<o:p>

The 0.35” fuzzy tube was too short to be very effective at wide angles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 0.5” fuzzy tube was slightly too long, because it affected the
boresight sensitivity, but of course the max gain could be increased to
compensate for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The boresight
sensitivity was unchanged by the paper tube and short fuzzy tube, but it was
limited by the set max distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
50 degrees, adding the paper tube reduced the detected distance for 45” to
zero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 0.5” fuzzy tube made
the sonar into a truly narrow-beam device, with no sidelobes beyond 30 degrees!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are no dead spots in the pattern like you might expect from
diffraction effects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tubes
helped in the up direction also, but not as dramatically.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You might want to experiment with different lengths of
tube, to see if sidelobes can be reduced further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe Velcro thicker fuzz or upholstery velvet would be a better
absorber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe a flare like a
trombone would be better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe a
long tube with a slight taper would not affect the center sensitivity, but still
kill off-axis sidelobes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe just
a horizontal flat surface would absorb the ground clutter.<o:p>
